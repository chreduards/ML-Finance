# Portfolio optimization algoritm
The algoritm will be constructed in steps. The goal is to rebalance an equity portfolio on a daily basis.
This algoritm will act as a proof of concept and will be the first step in a larger implementation.

Overview of Steps:
#### Implement Black Litterman using historical returns and expected returns from CAPM

#### Generate scenarios with Monte Carlo (Latin Hypercube)

#### Implement a primal dual solver

#### Rebalance the portfolio
