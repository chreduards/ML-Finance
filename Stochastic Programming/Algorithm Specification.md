# Portfolio optimization algoritm
The algoritm will be constructed in steps. The goal is to rebalance an equity portfolio on a daily basis.
This algoritm will act as a proof of concept and will be the first step in a larger implementation.

Overview of Steps:
#### -[] Implement Black Litterman using 
* [x] Historical returns 
* [x] Expected returns from CAPM
* [x] EWMA (Need volatility of historical returns to calculate the covariance of the historical returns)

#### [ ] Generate scenarios with Monte Carlo (Latin Hypercube)

#### [ ] Implement a primal dual solver

#### [ ] Rebalance the portfolio
